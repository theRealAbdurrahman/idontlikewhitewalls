User can offer help by privately messaging the question author, with optional public visibility of their intent

In a user wants to offer help to someone who posted a question, he can tap "I Can Help" on the Question, So that he can share relevant support while optionally letting others know I’ve offered to help, without revealing my actual message (only the recipient can see that)


Acceptance Criteria

1. Visual Structure

Step 1: Entry Point

- On every question card, there is an “I can help” button with:

  - Icon

  - Label: *“I can help”*

  - Counter of how many users have offered help

- Button appears to the right of "Me too"

Step 2: Private Chat Screen

- Chat Header: “I can help” (Instead of the Question asker name - Changes to asked name when the asker replies)

- Open chat window between user and the Question Author, insert a Preview with a snapshot of original question (name, profile, content) as a message from Question asker to User.

- Below that:

  - Chat-style message composer

  - Placeholder: *“This is how I can help \[Name\]...”* (Name = question author)

  - Toggle: *“Others can see you offered to help. Your message will remain private.”*

    - Default: ON

- Message input section:

  - Rich input bar (icons for image, microphone, location)

  - Send button

Step 3: After Sending

- The message appears in the chat interface (WhatsApp-style)

- User’s message is name and timestamped and styled distinctly

- Visibility toggle remains shown under their last message, disabled (since it's already been sent)

2. Functionality

- Tapping “I can help” on a question opens the private chat screen pre-loaded with the question preview

- User types their message and taps 'Send' button:

  - Message is sent privately to the question author

  - Toggle state (on/off) is saved per message

- Toggle “Others can see I offered to help”:

  - ON (default): The user's profile appears in the visible "I can help" count

  - OFF: User chooses to stay anonymous, only the question author can see it

- Message is always private, regardless of toggle state

- User can only send help messages once per question thread, until they receive a response

3. Design Specs

- Chat interface:

  - Input field padding and rounded edges

  - Toggle switch styled to Meetball's design system

  - Message bubbles styled like private DM apps

- Preview of question at top:

  - Cropped view with name, content, and hashtags

  - Not tappable for full view

- Toggle state:

  - default system toggles

  - Green = ON, Grey = OFF

  - Caption should wrap and scale on smaller screens

4. Edge Cases

- If user is not logged in, tapping “I can help” triggers login/signup flow

- If message fails to send, show toast message *“We lost you for a bit and the message couldn’t be sent. Try again.”*

- If toggle is off and user reopens the screen later, the toggle should persist their last choice

- If question is deleted or expired, show message: *“This question has been resolved and, or, is no longer active.”*

Notes for Dev

- Backend:

  - Save toggle value alongside message object

  - Messages stored in private thread tied to question ID

- Visibility logic:

  - If toggle = ON/OFF, user is included in public count

- Analytics:

  - Track usage of toggle, number of messages sent per question, and message open rates







Users checked into an Event can open a question to view the full post (public view) and see a list of users who interacted "Me Too" and "I Can Help" with it.

As a Meetball user,
I want to view the full content of a question,
And see a list of people who either said "Me Too" or "I Can Help",
So that I can connect with relevant people while respecting those who’ve opted out of messaging.
